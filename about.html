            Hello! I'm Santhosh Selva, a passionate engineering student currently in my pre-final year. I have a deep interest in technology, innovation, and making a positive impact on society. I've been involved in multiple projects, ranging from creating mobile
            apps like Citizen, aimed at fighting corruption, to developing solutions like Nilam, which connects farmers directly to customers.
            <br><br> My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience, such as completing the Google Cloud Study Jams course, participating in AI and ML workshops, and exploring fields like biometric integration for responsible alcohol regulation.
            <br><br> I also have a strong affinity for music and sound design, which I apply to short films, where Iâ€™ve contributed by composing and editing music and sound effects.
            <br><br> I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge, whether through participating in hackathons, working on chatbots like Edu Guard, or learning about emerging technologies like deepfake detection and cloud computing.
            <br><br> I aim to use my skills to create meaningful solutions that benefit society and help solve real-world problems. In all my professional endeavors, I prioritize collaboration, creativity, and making a tangible difference.
